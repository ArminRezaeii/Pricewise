Project Description: Price Tracker Web Application

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my latest web project - a dynamic Price Tracker built with cutting-edge technologies. This project is designed to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to track the prices of their favorite products on Amazon and receive alerts when the prices drop to their desired levels.

Key Features:

Amazon Product Scraping: The application is equipped with a powerful Amazon product scraper. Users can input the product link into the search bar, and the system will fetch detailed product data from Amazon, including product name, description, current price, and more.

Product Details Display: The scraped product details are beautifully displayed, allowing users to easily review essential information about their desired products.

Price Tracking: Users can set their preferred price threshold for a product. The system utilizes a cron job to periodically track the product's price, and once it drops to the specified level, users receive an email notification highlighting the lowest price ever recorded.

Technologies Used:

Next.js 14: Leveraging the latest version of Next.js, a React framework, to create a fast, dynamic, and scalable web application.

TypeScript: Ensuring robust and maintainable code by incorporating TypeScript for static typing.

Tailwind CSS: Employing the utility-first CSS framework to streamline the styling process and create a visually appealing user interface.

MongoDB: Utilizing MongoDB as the database to store user preferences, product details, and historical price data.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.
Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection details in the application.
Run the application locally using the appropriate npm/yarn command.
Navigate to the web application, input an Amazon product link, and start tracking prices effortlessly.
